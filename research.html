						<h2>Conjugated Polymers</h2>
						<p>
							Semiconducting conjugated polymers are promising for the development of cost-effective flexible electronic devices. The structures and morphologies of the conjugated polymer in solution are determinative to the device performance.<br><br>We develop a spectroscopic methodology to study the dynamic process of multi-scale assembly of the polymers controlled by surfactants and nanoparticles. In particular, we are interested in the kinetics and thermodynamics of structural changes of the conjugated polymer in solution.

                  <h2>Anisotropic Nanomaterials</h2>
						<p>
                  1-D and 2-D anisotropic semiconducting nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes and nanowires possess unique anisotropy of optoelectronic properties. The ability to assembly of such nanomaterials into macroscopically ordered structures is crucial to fully exploit such excellent properties for various applications. <br><br>We develop a liquid crystal route to organize anisotropic nanomaterials into useful material forms such as thin films and fibers. We focus on the phase diagram, alignment control and property optimization.  
						</p>
                  <h2>Polymer Nanocomposites</h2>
						<p>
                  1Polymer nanocomposites consist of a polymer having nanofillers incorporated into the polymer matrix. They not only combine the intrinsic properties of each component but also exhibit unprecedented intriguing properties due to the synergistic effect of their components. <br><br>We develop both chemical and physical approaches to prepare novel multi-functional nanocomposites for coatings and energy conversions. Currently, we are interested in the interfacial structures and their effect on the physical properties.  
						</p>
                  <h2>Smart Coatings/Printings</h2>
						<p>
                  Wet coatings and printings are cost-effective techniques for the fabrication of large-scale thin films. We utilize such industrially viable processing techniques to fabricate polymer photovoltaic devices, reverse osmosis membranes, and anticorrosion films for demanding applications.<br><br><br>
